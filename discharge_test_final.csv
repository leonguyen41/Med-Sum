IMAGING
-------
MRI T,L-spine (___):  
Compared with the prior thoracic spine MRI of ___, 
there is 
further collapse of the T2 pathologic fracture with likely 
epidural extension of metastatic disease.  Also, metastatic 
lesion within the T7 vertebral body has increased in size.  
There is new enhancing anterior and posterior epidural 
metastatic disease from T10 through L1 levels. 
  
There is stable extensive metastatic disease within the lumbar 
spine and 
pelvis as described above. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic 
low back pain, renal cell carcinoma s/p metastases to lumbar 
spine, sacrum, right iliac wing s/p XRT and chemotherapy 
(sutent) admitted with worsened low back pain. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Low back pain: Mr. ___ was admitted with acute on chronic 
low back pain.  He has known extensive renal cell carcinoma 
metastases to lumbar spine, T2, and T7.  MRI on this admission 
showed steady progression of the thoracic mets, particularly 
with T2 collapse and epidural extension.  Given concern for T2 
vertebra stability, neurosurgery was consulted and recommended 
that he have a full TLS (Somi) brace at all times while upright. 
 He, however, is not required to wear the brace when lying down 
at HOB <30 degs.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough 
that significant neck movement is prohibited.  The brace is 
designed to restrict neck movement - and thus precludes Mr. 
___ from driving.  With his interests in driving and his 
collection of multiple cars/trucks, this news was naturally 
quite distressing to Mr. ___.  Social Work was consulted to 
provide some coping.  It was communicated to Mr. ___ that it 
is unlikely that he will be able to drive ever again.  He would 
not be able to drive with the brace because of neck 
restrictions; he would not be able to drive without it because 
the risk of paralysis with T2 vertebra instability; and patient 
is already at significant risk with the high doses of opiates 
and pain medications.  During this stay, here, there was no 
cauda equina symptoms.  Pain was controlled with dexamethasone, 
Butrans patch, tramadol, NSAIDs, cyclobenzaprine, oxycodone PRN. 
 The Butrans patch was doubled to 20 ug/hr to provide stronger 
baseline relief of the pain.  ___ evaluated the patient and felt 
he was stable for discharge but would benefit from home physical 
therapy.  Training on the placement on removal of the brace was 
provided to the patient and his wife.  The ___ was 
contacted with paperwork stating that the patient is not 
medically safe to drive.  The patient refused to sign this 
paperwork. 

# Renal cell carcinoma: s/p XRT and chemotherapy (Sutent).  Mr. 
___ has been off the Sutent due to significant mucositis and 
nausea.  There has been near complete resolution of these 
symptoms.  There is some residual sacral wounds and wound 
consult made the following recommendations: Mepilex to back 
blisters to protect from friction from straps, Criticaid clear 
to perianal fissures Qshifts or pRN, pressure redistribution 
measures, limit sit time to 1 hour at a time.  He will follow 
with Dr. ___ to determine what chemo to 
initiate as an outpt

# Anemia: Mr. ___ has had decrease in Hct but no clear 
evidence of bleed.  There was no GI bleed noted and blood 
pressure was stable.  Hematocrit was followed serially. 

# Hiccups: patient was started on a trial of chlorpromazine 25mg 
TID x 7 days, which he will continue upon discharge

INACTIVE ISSUES
---------------
# Hypertension: stable, patient was continued on atenolol and 
hydrochlorthiazide.

# GERD: patient was continued on home omeprazole.

# Anxiety: no anxiolytics were provided while patient was 
admitted.
.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient will follow up with Oncology on discharge, 
for an appointment to be arranged after discharge.  He will be 
discharged with a Somi brace and wheelchair.  He should have a 
full TLS (Somi) brace on at all times while upright.  He, 
however, is not required to wear the brace when lying down at 
HOB <30 degrees.  The T2 compression fracture is high enough 
that significant neck movement is prohibited.  He will get home 
physical therapy.

# Code status: patient is confirmed full code.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure looking after you, Mr. ___.  As you know, 
you were admitted with increased pain in the back.  MRI of the 
spine showed progression of the cancer involvement of the T2 and 
T7 vertebrae.  The T2 vertebra (below the neck), in particular, 
was collapsed and revealed extension of the break into the 
spinal canal.   It is for this reason, that you should have the 
brace in place while you are upright.  This can be removed when 
you are lying down flat with the head below 30 degrees from 
horizontal.  You have verbalized that you understand the risks 
and potential consequences, namely paralysis, that can occur 
from not wearing the brace.

   Because of the limitations with the neck brace, you should 
not drive for risk of getting into an accident.  Driving without 
the brace is equally dangerous, as the T2 vertebra may press on 
the spinal cord and lead to paralysis - and thus a risk for 
yourself and others.  The ___ ___ has been contacted 
and your license is no longer active and you are not permitted 
by law to be driving.
  
  Please follow up with Dr. ___ about the 
next steps for your treatment.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF or pneumonia. 
 
___ ECHO: The left atrial volume is increased. The left 
atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to 
moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion 
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Diastolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. 
Small circumferential pericardial effusion with a small mobile 
echodensity seen near the RVOT, likely a mobile fat pad or 
fibrin within the effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, the degree of mitral regurgitation is 
slightly less and the pericardial effusion is new.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with palpatations and EKG consistent with new 
onset symptomatic atrial flutter.  
  
#. Atrial Flutter: The patient was monitored on telemetry and 
noted to be in aflutter with a HR up to 120 at times.  Her 
metoprolol dose was increased to 25 mg BID.  Given her CHADS 
score of 2, she was started on heparin and coumadin.  She was 
evaluated by electrophyiology and her heart rate only 
temporarily slowed in response to IV adenosine.  Plans were made 
for electrical cardioversion, however, she spontaneously 
converted to NSR on her second hospital day.  Given her 
intermittant symptoms and dilated left atrium on ECHO, she 
probably flips in and out of atrial flutter over time.  She does 
not appear to have any triggers for aflutter: no fevers or 
leukocytosis suggesting infection, no sign of heart failure or 
ischemia, and no hyperthyroidism.  In fact, her TSH was mildly 
elevated at 4.6, but free T4 was low normal at 0.98.  It was 
felt that no intervention regarding her TFTs is necessary at 
this time, though she should probably have these labs checked 
again in 6 months by her PCP.  
 
On discharge she was started on amiodarone 200 mg BID for one 
month, then 200 mg daily thereafter, to help control her rhythm. 
 As this medication will also slow her heart rate and she was 
bradycardic to the high ___ on a couple of occassions with 
metoprolol 25 mg bid, her home atenolol is being stopped on 
discharge.  LFTs were checked on the day of discharge and were 
normal.  PFTs were scheduled as an outpatient.  The patient will 
be going home with ___ of heart's monitor for 2 weeks, to be 
checked daily.  The patient will follow-up with Dr. ___ in 
cardiology in 1 month.  
  
#. CAD: The patient has no known history of CAD and her 
excercise MIBI in ___ was without any signs of ischemia.  She 
was continued on aspirin and a beta blocker.  
   
#. Pump: The patient appeared euvolemic on exam.  She has no 
known history of CHF and on ECHO had an LVEF > 55%.  The ECHO 
also showed a dilated left atrium, diastolic dysfunction, and a 
small peridcardial effusion.  These latter two findings were not 
active issues during this hospitalization.
 
#. Anti-coagulation: The patient was started on heparin IV and 
warfarin 5 mg daily on admission.  The patient is being 
discharged on warfarin 5 mg daily and has anticoagulation 
follow-up at the ___.
 
#. Hypertension: The patient was continued on her home dose of 
hydrochlorothiazide.  Her beta blocker was changed from atenolol 
to metoprolol 25 mg BID.  Her beta blocker is being stopped on 
discharge as amiodarone will likely slow her heart rate.  She 
maintained SBPs from 110s-140 during her hospitalization.
  
#. Hyperlipidemia: The patient was continued on pravastatin at 
her home dose. 
   
#. Occular hypertension: The patient was continued on timolol 
and put on latanoprost as bimatoprost is not on the hospital 
formulary.  Per the patient, she was not actively taking these 
medications at home.  She was encouraged to take these 
medications and speak with her eye physician about them.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
Atrial Flutter

Secondary Diagnoses:
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Ocular hypertension

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, satting well on room air, in normal sinus rhythm. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of palpitations.  Your 
heart was in an irregular rhythm called atrial flutter.  
However, your heart spontaneously went back into a normal rhythm 
while you were in the hospital.  Because you have had 
palpitations intermittantly over the past 3 months, your heart 
likely goes in and out of a normal rhythm frequently.  Because 
of this, you will need to start some new medications and also 
have your heart monitored at home for 2 weeks.  

You will be started on a new medication called amiodarone to 
help keep your heart in a normal rhythm.  Because this 
medication slows down your heart, you should stop taking 
atenolol.  You will also need to do some special tests of your 
lung function because you are taking this new medication.

You will also need to be on a blood thinning medication called 
warfarin to prevent blood clots from forming when your heart is 
in an abnormal rhythm.  You will need to have frequent follow-up 
after discharge to adjust the dose of this medication properly 
so that your blood is not too thick and not too thin.

Please follow-up with the cardiologist below.
 
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you 
develop chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, 
weakness on one side of your body, or any other concerning 
symptoms.

ASCITES FLUID ANALYSIS:
WBC 1025, RBC ___
CULTURES: PENDING
CYTOLOGY: PENDING

Transvaginal US ___:
Very limited study. The uterus appears normal. The ovaries 
could not be identified. A large amount of ascites is seen in 
the pelvis 

CT abdomen/pelvis ___:
Large ascites and omental caking/peritoneal implants raise 
concern 
for malignany, possibly due to colonic primary given eccentric 
wall thickening in the transverse colon. Correlate with 
colonoscopy. No obstruction.

Colonoscopy ___:
Diverticulosis of the whole colon
Poor prep in the right colon limited the view. If the cecum 
needs to be assessed then MAC would be recommended.
There were no masses or lesions seen in the transverse colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to distal ascending colon 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with pmh of HLD, HTN, Atrial flutter on coumadin that 
presents with 3 weeks of constipation and diffuse abdominal 
pain, found to large ascites and omental caking on CT scan, s/p 
negative colonoscopy and a ultrasound-guided paracentesis.

# Highly suspected neoplasm given finding of large ascites and 
omental caking on CT scan and history of 10# weight loss and 
decreased stool caliber.  It appeared that based on the initial 
CT scan of omental caking with thickening of the transverse 
colon, in addition to a clinical weight loss and change in bowel 
habits that colon cancer was the likely diagnosis.  However 
colonoscopy failed to reveal any masses with the entire colon.  
A transvaginal US was then performed in an attempt to better 
visualize the ovaries, however the test was of poor quality.  
Then pt was sent for a diagnostic and theraputic US guided 
paracentesis on the day of discharge.   Peritoneal fluid studies 
were pending at discharge.  MRI pelvis can be considered to 
assess for ovarian cancer.

# Constipation: Unclear etiology, possible ___ cancerous mass or 
ascites compressing the colon.  Rectal exam did not show stool 
in rectal vault and CT scan did not show obstruction or a large 
amount of stool.

# Atrial flutter:  Pt was well rate controlled during 
hospitalization.  Coumadin was held during hospitalization in 
preparation for a colonoscopy.  We restarted her coumadin on 
___ at the 5 mg dose.  Her INR on discharge was 1.0.

# HTN:  Well controlled on HCTZ and amlodipine

# Hypercholesterolemia:  Continued home dose of simvastatin.

# Occular hypertension:  Continued home eye drop regimen.

Ms. ___ will follow up in the ___ clinic on ___.  She 
will also have follow up at the ___ clinic on ___, at which 
time further arrangements can be made based on analysis of 
peritoneal fluid.

Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.
.
IMAGING:
.
CT of abd (___):
Large ascites and omental caking/peritoneal implants raise 
concern 
for malignany, possibly due to colonic primary given eccentric 
wall thickening in the transverse colon. The rectum and sigmoid 
colon are normal. The uterus is grossly  normal with numerous 
collaterals and a distended left ovarian vein. There is no 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The ovaries appear normal 
with a focal calcification in the right ovary
.
CT Abd/Pelv ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large volume ascites with omental and peritoneal implants 
compatible with malignancy. 
2. New loculated fluid collection within the right anterior 
abdominal wall with adjacent stranding may relate to recent 
paracentesis and given the adjacent inflammation, superimposed 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. Focal clot within a left gonadal vein.
. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with PMH of HTN, A-flutter, with recently  
diagnosed malignant ascites with adenocarcinoma cells (of 
unknown primary) with CT demonstrating peritoneal implants and 
transverse colon thickening. Transvaginal ultrasound unable to 
identify ovaries due to excess ascitic fluid. She now presents 
with a sudden onset of right sided abdominal 
pain/constipation/obstipation, and dx paracentesis suggestive of 
SBP.  
.
Active Diagnoses:
.
#Stage IV Poorly Differentiated Gastric Adenocarcinoma with 
signet ring features: Ms. ___ was admitted with abdominal 
pain and constipation and found to have evidence of widely 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary throughout her 
peritoneum. Differential diagnosis included colonic despite 
negative colonoscopy, ovarian (given poor visualization by 
vaginal ultrasound), primary peritoneal, or upper GI source. An 
___ biopsy taken from omental caking was positive for 
adenocarcinoma (confirming ascitic fluid cytology results). 
Given the patient's significant history of gastritis, EGD was 
performed which showed larged gastric tumor which was biopsied 
with pathology significant for poorly differentiated gastric 
adenocarcinoma with signet ring features. She was discharged 
with outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ futher management 
of her malignancy.
.
#Malignant Ascites/Abdominal Pain/Obstipation: On admission Ms. 
___ complained of abdominal pain and lack of BM's or flatus 
for several days which raised concern for SBO despite lack of 
SBO on CT abdomen performed in ED. She was also found to have 
tense ascites and underwent diagnostic paracentesis in the ED 
which showed ascitic fluid which a high white count and >250 
poly's despite being lymphocyte predominant which raised concern 
for bacterial peritonitis from paracentesis performed during 
prior admission. She was also found to have a loculated 
abdominal wall mass at the site of her prior paracentesis. She 
was afebrile, alert and oriented, and did not have diffuse 
abdominal tenderness on exam. Additionally, the site of her 
loculated fluid collection was not particularly warm, 
erythematous, tender, or fluctuant. She was started on IV 
ceftriaxone emprirically pending culture results of her dx para 
fluid and ceftriaxone was d/c'd when her cultures came back 
negative. She underwent therapeutic paracentesis which removed 
~1.5L of fluid and greatly improved her abdominal discomfort and 
constipation. She was also given an aggressive bowel regimen and 
was able to pass BM's and flatus frequently.  
.  
# Hx of Aflutter: Per Dr. ___ had one known episode of 
aflutter while previously hospitalized and is not currently in 
aflutter and probably hasn't been since. As a result, it was 
determined that she did not require anticoagulation as her risk 
for bleeding was thought to outweigh her risk for cardioembolic 
event. Her home warfarin was d/c'd and she was given instruction 
to follow-up with her outpatient providers for further 
discussion of this issue.  
.  
#Hyponatremia/Hypokalemia: This was a new finding for this 
patient with a Na of 129. It remained stable after placing her 
on a 1.2L fluid restriction.  
.
Chronic Diagnoses: 
.
# Heartburn: Stable, likely related to or contributing to 
formation of her gastric cancer. She was treated symptomatically 
with pantoprazole, maalox, and tums  
.
Transitional Issues: Ms. ___ was discharged with close 
follow-up with Dr. ___ continued outpatient management 
of her newly diagnosed gastric cancer. She was also advised to 
discuss the discontinuation of her warfarin with her PCP.

Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PleurX abdominal catheter placement ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is an ___ year-old ___ speaking female with a 
history of recently diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma with mets 
to the peritoneum, recurrent abdominal ascites, atrial flutter, 
who presented ___ for elective pleurex catheter placement into 
the peritoneum.  Her ascites was drained 5 days prior to 
admission, and since that procedure, she has had increasing poor 
appetite and fluid intake.  In the intake suite, she was found 
to be tachycardic to 160s. At that time, she was completely 
asymptomatic without chest pain, palpitations, and had only mild 
shortness of breath comparable to her baseline.  She was taken 
to the ER for further management.  
.  
In the ED, initial vs were: HR 161 134/71 20 100% 4L. ECG showed 
atrial flutter at 154. Patient was given 2L NS, HR remained in 
150s. She was given 15 mg IV diltiazem with initial improvement 
of HR into ___, then resturned to 100s. placed on a diltiazem 
drip. She was then given 30 mg PO diltiazem, another 15 IV dilt, 
then started on diltiazem drip at 10 cc/hr, still in atrial 
flutter. CTA showed bilateral PE, no RV strain. After discussion 
with the family, decision was made to start a heaprin drip and 
she was transferred to the ICU for rate control.  In the ICU, 
after initial attempt to transition to oral diltiazem was 
unsuccessful, a second attempt was effective, and she was able 
to be transferred to the floor without any incident.  At that 
time, she felt well and was stable.  Of note, after discussion 
with the patient and her family about the risks and benefits of 
anticoagulation for PEs including need for blood tets for 
monitoring, they elected to not pursue anticoagulation therapy.

REPORTS
EKG ___: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular 
response, although there is some organized atrial activity. The 
variable ventricular response suggests atrial fibrillation 
(atrial flutter). No significant change compared to the previous 
tracing except that the current ventricular response is more 
variable suggesting the combination of atrial fibrillation and 
flutter.

EKG ___: The rate is much slower with persistent 
flutter/fibrillation waves with a regular ventricular response 
suggesting conducted atrial fibrillation.

CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and small 
bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiomegaly.

CTA Chest ___: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary emboli involving the 
right middle and lower lobar as well as left lower lobar 
pulmonary arteries without evidence of right heart strain. Small 
bilateral simple pleural effusions are slightly increased.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with end stage gastric adenocarcinoma with 
metastases to peritpneum and a history of atrial flutter 
requesting comfort measures only who presents with atrial 
flutter and PE prior to placement of PleurX abdominal catheter.

ACTIVE ISSUES

1. Atrial Flutter: Patient presented with palpitations and HR 
>150 prior to placement of adbominal catheterization. Because 
she was symptomatic from her atrial flutter, it was deemed 
reasonable to rate control her. Patient initially controlled 
with IV diltiazem drip and transitioned to 90mg diltiazem qid. 
Rate was controlled to the 70's-100's with one asymptomatic runs 
back to 150. Patient was discharged on 360mg diltiazem ER. No 
anticoagulation prophylaxis on discharge as per patient's goals 
of care.
.  
2. PE: Bilateral PE was visualized on CTA, likely precipitated 
in setting of end-stage malignancy. There was no evidence of 
hemodynamic compromise or RV strain. Patient was briefly started 
in heparin drip. However, discussed with patient and her family 
that treatment of a PE consists of heparin and ___ months of 
coumadin or lovenox shots. Also explained that because of her 
cancer, she has a high risk of developing more clots even while 
on coumadin. Thus, because coumadin requires frequent blood 
draws and carries a risk of bleed, this would not be consistent 
with her goals of care. Heparin drip was discontinued on 
transfer to floor
.  
3. Recurrent ascites: Likely secondary to malignancy. Patient 
underwent PleurX abdominal catheter placement ___ for 
palliation.
.  
4. Stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma. No further treatment under 
current goals of care.

decreased abdominal Pleurx drainage.
.
She was recently admitted ___ to ___ with atrial flutter 
and shortness of breath.  She was treated for atrial flutter 
with a diltiazem drip and then oral diltiazem.  She also was 
initially heparinized for her PE but per the discharge summary, 
frequent blood draws or injections would not be consistent with 
her goals of care and anticoagulation was discontinued.  She 
also had a Pleurx abdominal catheter placed for palliation due 
to recurrent ascites.
.
She reports having intermittent abdominal pain around the site 
of the Pleurx since discharge.  She then had progressive 
shortness of breath over the last ___ days which worsened this 
AM and prompted her to present to the ED.  She also reports that 
her ___ went to drain her Pleurx today which didn't drain as

excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 
CT chest/abd/pelvis: 
1. Interval development of hyperenhancement and thickening of 
the peritoneum with large volume loculated ascites raises 
concern for peritonitis. Presence of gas within peritoneum could 
be due to indwelling catheter though gas forming organism cannot 
be excluded. This finding was discussed with ___ 
at 19:24 on ___ by ___ over the phone. 
2. Small bowel wall thickening likely reactive given the concern 
for infected peritoneal fluid. No bowel obstruction.  
3. Unchanged bilateral pulmonary emboli. 
4. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower 
lobe consolidation, likely reflects atelectasis and aspiration.

#. Shortness of Breath/Pulmonary Embolus: shortness of breath 
and pleuritic chest pain likely related to known PE, confirmed 
on CTA.  She was mildly hypoxic (92% on RA) but in no 
respiratory distress.  After discussion with the patient and her 
family, they opted to start anticoagulation (they had reportedly 
declined last admission).  Lovenox was started and provided to 
patient upon discharge.

#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: HR to 150s in the ED, given 
10mg IV dilt x 2 and 30mg po dilt with some response (HR 
decreased to 120s).  In the MICU she was continued on home 
diltiazem 90mg po qid with PRN IV dilt for rate control as well 
as fluids.  Anticoagulation as above.
.
#. Pneumoperitoneum/non-draining pleurex: Found to have locules 
of gas within ascites on abdominal CT scan, which was initially 
felt to be due to catheter placement rather than perforation 
given her benign abdominal exam.  A small amount of ascitic 
fluid was sampled and showed 825 WBCs (65% polys), cultures were 
sent, and she was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for 
presumed bacterial peritonitis. Culture grew bacteroides 
fragilis. ___ re-examined the CT abdomen, and felt that the 
pleurex catheter looked like it had been placed through her 
colon. Therefore they say that they cannot pull the catheter for 
it will leave two open holes in her colon in communication with 
her peritoneum.  Therefore, they said, that a functional study 
of it is not worth while.  The ___ attending advised the ACS 
attending, and decision to leave catheter in place was discussed 
with family. On the floor, patient was switched to cipro and 
flagyl prior to discharge.
.
#. Stage IV Gastric Adenocarcinoma: Focusing on palliation 
currently as has extensive disease. Remeron was started to help 
stimulate appetite.
.
#. Hyponatremia: At recent baseline. Thought to be possibly 
exacerbated by poor po intake and patient was provided IVF's.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had decreased 
output from your pleurX catheter and abdominal pain. A CT scan 
of your belly was concerning for either perforation of your 
colon or the catheter lying very close to the colon. However, 
since your abdominal pain got better and you didn't have any 
fevers we decided the best approach was to not disturb the 
catheter, which you can continue to use. We will give you some 
antibiotics for the next several days to help prevent infection.

Additionally, your heart rate was noted to be high and in an 
abnormal rhythm called atrial fibriallation. We provided you 
with a continous drip of medicine to slow your heart rate, and 
it resolved. We will continue on medicine to help control your 
heart rate.

Please note the following medication changes:
START Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily through ___
START Flagyl: 500mg three times a day ___
START Lovenox 90mcg once daily indefinitely
START Mirtazipine 15mg every evening to help your appetite

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with history of dementia (AAOx2 at 
baseline), HTN, HLD who was sent in from his ___ with SOB and 
chest pain, found to have NSTEMI which was medically managed, 
course complicated by tachy-brady syndome s/p PPM and GI bleed.
.  
# NSTEMI:  The patient ruled in for NSTEMI with trop of 0.16.  
Given the patient's dementia and goals of care, it was decided 
that medical management would be the best option. He was loaded 
with Plavix and completed 48 hours on a heparin gtt. He had an 
ECHO done which showed normal systolic function. 
- follow up with cardiology
.
# Tachy-brady syndrome: Patient found to have episodes of atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in addition to 
episodes of bradycardia. Goals of care discussion elicited that 
it would be in the patient's benefit to undergo PPM placement. 
PPM was placed on ___ without complication. After PPM 
placement beta blockade was initiated to control further 
episodes of afib with rapid ventricular response.
.
# Kidney injury: Patient with acute kidney injury in ___ was 
1.4 that per office records he was supposed to repeat and had 
not, of unclear etiology despite multiple attempts to elucidate 
prior baseline and course of kidney injury. Patient was admitted 
with Cr of 2.0 and thiazide was held. FeNa was 0.57% with urine 
sodium of 58. He responded minimally to fluid challenge. Upon 
discharge, Cr was 2.6.
- recommend repeat labs drawn in one week to monitor Cr, labs to 
be sent to MD following at ___
.
# HTN:  The patient was initially continued on metoprolol and 
amlodipine when he was first admitted.  His thiazide was held in 
the setting of his kidney injury. After developing bradycardic 
episodes metoprolol was held until PPM placed and then 
restarted. Hydralazine was increased for improved BP control. 
.
# Anemia/GI bleed: Patient was noted to have downtrending 
hematocrit and guaiac positive stool. He received 1u PRBCs and 
his hematocrit stabilized. GI was consulted, who felt risk of 
colonoscopy in the initial 30 day period from ___ outweighed 
potential benefits. Colonoscopy was deferred to the outpatient 
setting should the family wish to pursue it. 
- f/u with GI for colonoscopy 3 weeks after discharge
.
# Alzheimer's dementia: The patient has a history of Alzheimer's 
dementia, AAOx2 at his baseline. While in house, he was 
continued on his home medications, donepezil, memantine, and 
olanazapine. Delirium precautions were taken, including 
minimizing tethers, ensuring adequate pain control, frequent 
reorientation, and orientation to day/night cycle. 
.
# Delirium: Patient developed delirium, likely in the setting of 
PPM placement and extended hospital stay. Per family, patient 
had become combative in the past and often a sign the patient 
had the urge to urinate. No evidence of infection or 
leukocytosis, and delirium resolved with frequent reorientation.
.
# Depression: Continued on his home citalopram 20 mg daily. 
.
# Fungal infection: The patient was noted to have fungal 
infection in skin folds and he was continued on antifungal 
powder.
.
# GERD: The patient's omeprazole was changed to pantoprazole in 
the setting of starting Plavix and the potential interactions 
between plavix and omeprazole.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to 
___. You were admitted to the hospital because you had a heart 
attack. We started you on blood thinning medications to help 
treat your heart attack and adjusted your blood pressure 
medications. 

You also had an abnormal heart rhythm that required a pacemaker. 
You tolerated the procedure well.

You were also admitted with worsening kidney injury which was 
noted in a previous doctor's visit in ___. This may be because 
you are not eating and drinking as well as you once were. 

Your blood levels dropped and you were found to have occult 
blood in your stool. The gastroenterologists were consulted and 
did not feel it would be necessary to intervene so soon after 
your heart attack due to the risks. You should follow up with 
the gastroenterologists in the next few weeks if you wish to 
pursue colonoscopy to find the source of the bleeding. You 
received a blood transfusion and your blood levels stabilized. 

Please see the attached sheet for your updated medication list. 

Please make sure to follow up with your doctors.

CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old woman with HTN, HLD who presents after 
falling x2 in the last 2 weeks.  
. 
# Fall: Patient reports vague leg symptoms that have developed 
over the past few months, predominantly in the back of the legs 
without any true weakness, pain, numbness, tingling, bowel or 
bladder incontinence that would be concerning for a spinal cord 
compression. Although the patient has iritis, she has no visual 
complaints and so vision change unlikely to have caused the 
fall. Iritis in conjunction with posterior column symptoms could 
possibly be related to syphilis, though the patient reports 
extensive work up for iritis in the past has not revealed any 
etiology. Patient also borderline bradycardic, which could cause 
poor cerebral perfusion though again the patient's symptoms were 
mostly in her legs, and she denies any dizziness.  Finally, she 
also c/o some proximal mm weakness (thighs) and the family 
supported the story that she seems to have difficulty climbing 
stairs.   We decided to hold her atenolol, especially since her 
BPs have been okay on lisinopril and HCTZ.  her TSH, B12 were 
normal, and an RPR was pending at the time of discharge.  ___ saw 
the patient and felt that outpatient ___ would be beneficial. A 
script was provided for the patient for outpatient ___.  
Neurology also saw the patient who felt that posterior column 
pathology is the most likely cause of her fall.  They have also 
suggested that she see Neurology in f/u as an outpatient.  
Finally, she was ruled out for an MI with 3 sets of cardiac 
enzymes which were negative.
.
Of note, ___ saw the patient and felt that she could use 
outpatient ___ and also was provided with a walker.
.  
# Hypertension:  As above, we held atenolol given the 
possibility that bradycardia could have caused the fall.  She 
was continued on lisinopril and HCTZ.  Of note, she did have 
some hypokalemia here, and so we recommend a repeat lab check as 
an outpatient.  Also, we asked her to check her BP off of 
atenolol as an outpatient either at home or at a pharmacy to 
ensure she is not running hypertensive.  She understands close 
follow up will be important.
.  
# Hypokalemia: Likely ___ HCTZ.  She was repleted with potassium 
in house, and we suggested she have her labs checked by her PCP 
___. 
.  
# RBCs in urine: Unclear if patient had any foley trauma in the 
ED.  As her Hct was stable, she was discharged for outpt f/u for 
possible referral for cystoscopy and ___ stones.
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: Possible statin myopathy given pt's vague MSK 
complaints, however CK is nl, so will continue.  We felt that 
she could potentially try a trial off of statins in the future 
for possible statin induced myopathy
.  
# Iritis: continued eye drops.  We felt it was very unlikely 
that the steroids from her eye gtts would be enough to cause a 
steroid myopathy.
.
# Anemia: iron studies were sent and are pending at time of 
discharge.
.  
# Depression: continued paroxetine
.
# Followup: We have asked the patient to schedule an appointment 
with her PCP ___ 1 week of discharge.  We have asked her to 
speak with her PCP regarding the following issues:
- following up RPR results
- Repeat Chem-7 to evaluate possible hypokalemia ___ HCTZ
- Referral for neurology f/u for possible posterior column 
pathology
- Outpatient ___ referral (script already provided)
- Consider trial off of simvastatin to see if ?proximal mm 
weakness improves.
