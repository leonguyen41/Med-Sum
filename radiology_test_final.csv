intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed with 5-mm
slice thickness.

CT ABDOMEN:  Tiny bilateral pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis
are noted. There is no focal consolidation. There is no pericardial effusion
although the heart is slightly enlarged. 

Multiple hypodensities within the liver, some of which are too small to
characterize and others of which are cysts, the largest measuring 3.6 x 3.2 x
4.9 cm near the hepatic dome are seen. There are no definite liver lesions
suspicious for metastases on this single phase study. A splenic calcification
suggests exposure to prior granulomatous disease. The gallbladder, pancreas
and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and
excrete contrast promptly without hydronephrosis.  Multiple hypodensities are
seen in the kidneys bilaterally, some of which are too small to characterize
and others of which are cysts, the largest measuring 3.0 x 3.5 cm in the left
interpolar region. 

The small is normal in course and calibur without obstruction. No discrete
colon lesion is seen although eccentric wall thickening in the transverse
colon, just distal to the hepatic flexure (2:41, 601b: 17) raises the
possibility of colonic malignancy. There is mild colonic fecal loading without
obstruction. There is no free air. Large simple ascites with omental caking,
is worrisome for malignant ascites. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in
the normal caliber aorta.  The main portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV are
patent. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes
are present.

CT PELVIS:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal.  The uterus is grossly
normal with numerous collaterals and a distended left ovarian vein.  There is
no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The ovaries appear normal with a focal
calcification in the right ovary. Pelvic ascites tracks from the abdomen.

FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is normal in appearance.  Mediastinum is unremarkable
with the exception of a small axial hiatal hernia.  Atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted in the aorta.  The aorta and major branches are
patent with normal three-vessel arch.  There is no axillary, hilar,
supraclavicular, or mediastinal adenopathy, though scattered non-enlarged
nodes are seen.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable, with trace
pericardial effusion as on the prior abdominal CT.  Small bilateral simple
pleural effusions are slightly increased.    The lungs are otherwise clear
without focal opacity. There are pulmonary emboli involving the right middle
and lower lobar as well as left lower lobar pulmonary arteries.  The right
ventricle is not enlarged to suggest right heart strain.  

Though the study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, imaged upper
abdomen demonstrates cirrhotic liver with multiple hypodensities, better
characterized on previous CT of the abdomen and pelvis as well as moderate
volume ascites, similar to the prior study.

PROCEDURE:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient along with
an interpreter after explaining the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the
procedure.  The patient was brought into the angio suite and placed supine on
the table.  The right flank and left arm were prepped and draped in a sterile
fashion.

The patient did not have any venous access, so venous access was obtained on
the left arm through the brachial vein.

Now, the attention was shifted to the right flank.  A pocket of ascites was
identified by ultrasound and a micropuncture needle was placed in the ascitic
pocket and a guidewire was passed through the micropuncture needle, which was
then exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.  Then, attention was shifted to
performing a tunnel, which was made superiorly and medial to the entrance
site.  The track was anesthetized with lidocaine and epinephrine. A ___ was
given at the entrance of the tunnel and a tunneling device was used to tunnel
the Pleurx catheter through the abdomen ending at the entrance site. Then,
serial dilations were performed at the entrance site and a peel-away sheath
was introduced.  The Pleurx catheter was introduced through the peel-away
sheath and the placement was confirmed fluoroscopically.  Then, the venotomy

COMPARISON:  chest CTA dated ___ and CT abdomen/pelvis from ___.

FINDINGS:

CHEST:  The visualized portion of the thyroid appears unremarkable.  There is
no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The aorta is of normal
caliber along its course without evidence of dissection or intramural
hematoma.  The pulmonary arterial trunk is of normal caliber. There is no
change in the extent and distribution of pulmonary emboli within the branches
of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe basal segments, lingular branch,
and left lower lobe basal segments.  The heart shows no evidence of right
heart  strain.  There is trace pericardial thickening/effusion.  Moderate
simple layering pleural effusions are increased from prior, with associated
compressive lower lobe atelectasis. There is fluid distension of the esophagus
which can predispose patient to aspiration. There is likely a component of
aspiration resulting in the basilar consolidations. 

ABDOMEN:  Several liver hypodense lesions appear stable and are most
compatible with cysts. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen contains a coarse
calcification and appears stable.  The pancreas is atrophic.  The adrenal
glands are normal. The kidneys enhance normally. There are multiple bilateral
renal cysts, though several atre too small to fully characterize.  

A peritoneal drain enters the right abdominal wall and the tip resides in the
right mid-abdomen. There is loculation of ascitic fluid with thickening and
hyperenhancement of the surrounding peritoneum. This appearance is very
concerning for peritonitis. There are locules of gas within the peritoneum
which could be secondary to the indwelling peritoneal drain. The possibility
of gas formining organism is difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of
bowel perforation. There is, however, small bowel submucosal edema involving
the bowel which is surrounding by the loculated ascites. Given the stated
concern for infected fluid, the bowel wall thickening could be reactive. There
is no bowel onstruction. 

There is again noted to be peritoneal carcinomatosis evidenced by omental
implants. There is likely serosal disease of bowel.  A 3.0 x 1.3 cm (3b;119)
soft tissue mass is seen in the left anterior abdominal wall, concerning for
metastatic seeding of a prior paracentesis tract.

The aortal is normal in course and caliber with scattered atherosclerotic
calcification. The IVC is flattened and not visualized just inferior to the
renal veins. There may be thrombus within a left iliac vein on series 3b,
image 127. 

PELVIS:  Bladder appears unremarkable.  The uterus demonstrates calcification
within the myometrium, likely vascular.  The rectum appears unremarkable. 
There is free fluid contiguous with the ascites in the abdomen.  No
lymphadenopathy is seen. 

BONES:  No aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen. Diffuse
body wall edema noted. 

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval development of hyperenhancement and thickening of the peritoneum
with large volume loculated ascites raises concern for peritonitis. Presence
of gas within peritoneum could be due to indwelling catheter though gas
forming organism cannot be excluded. This finding was discussed with ___
___ at 19:24 on ___ by ___ over the phone.
2.  Small bowel wall thickening likely reactive given the concern for infected
peritoneal fluid. No bowel obstruction. 
3.  Unchanged bilateral pulmonary emboli.
4.  Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower lobe
consolidation, likely reflects atelectasis and aspiration.
5.  Extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis.
