      "Dear Ms. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we did a paracentesis to remove 5L of fluid from your belly. We also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with . ___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. We wish you all the best! Your ___ Team.\n"
